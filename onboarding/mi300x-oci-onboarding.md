# MI300X Onboarding	Details

## Introduction
OCI is adding AMD Instinct MI300X GPU accelerators as a Bare Metal shape. MI300X is AMD's flagship GPU accelerator that is designed for the largest and most complex training and inference applications. The OCI AMD MI300X offering supports single node and multi-node scale-out solutions to support Al and HPC workloads.

Each Bare Metal offering starts with AMD Instinct MI300X GPU accelerators and Intel Sapphire Rapids CPUs, providing 112 OCPUs. Each node has (8) MI300X GPUs connected by AMD Infinity Fabric and each GPU features 400 GB/s of interconnect bandwidth. MI300X offers industry-leading HBM capacity and bandwidth, 192 GB of HBM3 memory per GPU or a total of 1.56 TB per node. With larger memory capacity and bandwidth, customers can train faster or serve larger models, using fewer GPUs, at a lower cost.
